How it's gonna be made is;

-First thing first there will be several circles to represent planets in a scene full of stars and stuff for the rest of the visible universe and this part will be a picture only.-the part of stars etc. not planets-

-There will be an main charachter in a confined space and this space is gonna be our spaceship.

-All these stuffs are gonna be ina large box and this box is gonna be the game's environment.

-For now I think like main charachter will never move but the rest of the environmet do.
